[![Maintenance Status][maintenance-image]](#maintenance-status)

Unlike [react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable), the
[dynamic import](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#dynamic-import) support
offered by Next.js does not expose a way to preload the dynamically imported
components in Jest‚Äôs environment (which mimics a DOM environment). Even if you
get a handle on the `Loadable` component bundled with Next.js, it skips queuing
up the components in DOM-like environments. Bummer!

This module can be imported in your test or setup files to make sure any
component created with `next/dynamic` is added to a queue, which can then be
flushed with the exported `preloadAll` function.

Using this, your component tests (including snapshots) can render the full
component tree instead of the loading placeholders.

## Setup

In order to transform `import()` successfully in Jest‚Äôs environment, you must
use a different transform than the one provided by `next/babel` (which expects
to be built with webpack).

Both of these work fine:

- [babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node)
- [babel-plugin-transform-dynamic-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-dynamic-import)

```json
{
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node"]
}
```

## Usage

```js
// This will mock `next/dynamic`, so make sure to import it before any of your
// components.
import preloadAll from "jest-next-dynamic";
// This component can have dynamic imports anywhere in its rendered tree,
// including nested dynamic imports.
import SomeComponent from "./SomeComponent";

beforeAll(async () => {
  await preloadAll();
});

// Your tests here!
```
